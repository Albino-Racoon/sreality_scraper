# sreality_scraper
scraper that scrapes sreality website https://www.sreality.cz/en/search/for-sale/apartments (title and image url) saves it into postgres  db and shows it on localhost


!NOTE!: 
1. the code is "slow" becouse i used sleep function so that page loads and so that i dont get locked out of it becouse i am not shure if you guys have permission to scrape that website its just a precausion
2. I used selenium and webdriver in order to extract the data i am not shure how that will behave with Docker and becouse of that I am also uploading a video of how the code works (link:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5bXvlwEHO4  )
